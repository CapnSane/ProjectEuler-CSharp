# About this repo

## What is Project Euler?

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.
Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.

## Why did I choose solve the problems?

Now, I've decided learning a new programming language, and the chosen one was C#. I have another repository for learning Python and JavaScript, this one shall be dedicated only for C# coding. Let's learn!

# SPOILER ALERT!

This repository is only for practicing my Python, JavaScript, and C# abilities, I'm not depriving others of going through the same process by publishing my solution outside of Project Euler. DO IT BY YOURSELF. Only check the answers after doing them by yourself.

If you want to discuss about the processes I took solving the problems, feel free to ask me about it.
